        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Currently, a Stay-at-home Dad with over 14 years experience as a Finance Manager and Analyst. I have wanted to become a programmer since I first started using VBA in my spreadsheet and database projects. Now that I have more time available, I am pursuing the track of becoming a Full Stack Developer by studying full-time at Treehouse.</p>
        <p>I have experience in the following industries: SaaS, satellite television, and personal insurance. My hobbies are coding (of course), hiking, and reading. My children are my main source of inspiration and motivation.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to master the process of building web sites on both the front- and back-end, continually expanding my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would enjoy working for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence or for a company with an in-house web development team. And, if I can obtain a position that benefits by the addition of my Finance background, that would be even better.</p>
