          <hr>
          <p>Currently, I have over 14 years experience as a Finance Manager and Analyst with a passion for technology. I have wanted to become a programmer since I first started using VBA and SQL in my spreadsheet and database projects. I am pursuing a career as a Full Stack Web Developer by studying at Treehouse in my spare time as a Stay-at-home Dad.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I have experience in the following industries: SaaS, satellite television, and personal insurance. My hobbies are coding (of course), reading, and listening to a wide variety of podcasts. My children are my main source of inspiration and motivation.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>My goals are to master the process of building web sites on both the front- and back-end, continually expanding my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Rails</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>I would enjoy working for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence or for a company with an in-house web development team. And, if I can obtain a developer position that benefits from the addition of my Finance background, that would be better still.</p>
